Server-Side Request Forgery:(SSRF)
===========================
allows the attacker to induce the server-side application to make HTTP requests to server itself, or to other web-based services within the organization's infrastructure, or to external third-party systems
A successful SSRF attack can often result in unauthorized actions or access to data within the organization, either in the vulnerable application itself or on other back-end systems that the application can communicate with. In some situations, the SSRF vulnerability might allow an attacker to perform arbitrary command execution.
SSRF attacks against the server itself:
	attacker induces the application to make an HTTP request back to the server that is hosting the application, via its loopback network interface.
	supplying a URL with a hostname like 127.0.0.1 or localhost
