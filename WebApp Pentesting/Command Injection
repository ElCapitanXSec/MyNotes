Command Injection:
=================
Basics:
	commands sent can have 2 types of result:
		local results:(aka visible results)
			when results are returned to browser
			example:
				ls /etc
				netstat -an
		remote results:(aka blind results)
			when results are not returned to browser
			example:
				ping ourself
& => run next command regardless
&& => run next command if 1st one is succesful
|| => run next command
| => run next command
; => run next command
