Advice:
======
took melatonin the night before to help get a good nights rest
write the first ten labs you do as the report! If you don't do this now you might not have time later! If you already started the lab, start documenting your very next 10 boxes.

as soon as you get your 10th lab report done, stop and format all the lab reports together. I underestimated how much work it would take to format the reports and ran out of time. Plus learning how to do it now will be HUGE for when you need to write the exam report.
