For Notes	
	Tips on using KeepNote:
		Take a screenshot by pressing CTRL-INSERT.
		Run KeepNote off an SSD hard drive otherwise it can be sluggish.
		If possible, don't attach files into KeepNote or it might corrupt your notes. Try to keep sploits/files in a separate directory on your PC.
		Spend a few hours setting up your folder structure.
		Make frequent backups. I backup my KeepNote notebook every 3-4 hours
