USING MOBILEDIT FORENSIC EXPRESS:-
================================
=>basics:-
%understanding recovery:-
    it is a small piece of software that runs in the recovery partition on your device. once we boot into that partion we can see/change files on our device without any authenciation as android is not booted.
    every device by deafult has a recovery prog but user cant access it so we change it with "twrp" which gives us access of diff parts of our device.
    (twrp=> Team Win Recovery Project- this is the software that allows you to manually install ROMs)
    TWRP even comes with built-in file manager with unlimited root access so you can modify, add or delete any system files manually. The most important thing is that TWRP has a working MTP connection and ADB enabled which allows us to extract almost all data stored on your device and even create physical images from them.
    ("flashing twrp"=>it means to install twrp)
%rooting:-
	it gives us administrator right to change/remove anything in our phone.
%bootloader:-
	a prog which is responsible for loading an os
     type-1:- locked bootloader= it only boots os of which it approves of
     type-2:- unlocked bootloader=
\\\\\\\aim:- remove password from android device\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
unlock bootloader=> install twrp=> use to remove any lock screen
=> rooting phone
   why=> bcoz we need to recover deleted data so we need to root our phone.
   how-to root:- KINGOROOT(App) or XDA developers(online community) 
=> booting into recovery mode:-
   how-to=> hot-key combinations=> search google "hot-key combinations (manufacturer name)"
=> unlocking BOOTLOADER
   =>need= allows us to install custom Firmware i.e. helps in adding twrp.
   how-to:- 
   step-1:- Install ADB and Fastboot (Minimal ADB and Fastboot) 
   (adb=> Android Debug Bridge, allows the user to communicate and control their Android device using command line)
   step-2:- developer options(in settings of phone)=>turn on "OEM unlock" & "usb debugging"  
   (OEM=> Original Equipment Manufacturer)
   step-3:-connect phone, open cmd, go to where fastboot and adb is intalled
   step-4:-type:- "adb devices"
   (to see if your device is recognized by ADB)
   step-5:-adb reboot bootloader
   (reboots device to fastboot mode)
   step-6:-type-"fastboot OEM unlock"
   (command to unlock bootloader on supported devices)
   step-7:-type-"fastboot reboot"
   (to reboot again and boom we are done)
=>once we unlocked it, we need to install twrp
   => process for Samsung devices:-
   step-1:- developer options(in settings of phone)=>turn on "OEM unlock" & "usb debugging"
   step-2:- Odin 3.09 or newer (on pc)
   step-3:- restart phone into "Download mode" by turning it off and holding the volume down,home,power buttons for a few seconds.
   step-4:- start odin & connect phone to pc
   step-5:- once it recognizes a new device, make sure that "re-partition" option is disabled.
   step-6:- click on ap and choose path for your twrp image (we need to download it )
   (link:- https://dl.twrp.me/twrp/)
   => process for non-Samsung devices:-
   step-1:- enable "usb debugging" in phone
   step-2:- connnect phone (only when adb and fastboot are installed)
   step-3:- move to their installation folder in cmd
   step-4:- type:-"adb devices"
   step-5:- type:-"adb reboot bootloader" 
   step-6:- copy twrp image where adb and fastboot is installed
   step-7:- rename it to "twrp.img" (just for ease of using it)
   step-8:- type:-"fastboot flash recovery twrp.img" 
   (command to flash any recovery image)
   step-9:- type:-"fastboot reboot"
=>now, using twrp:- to remove any lockscreeen on any android device
   step-1:- upon rebooting=> click on advanced=>file manager
   step-2:- go to data\system
   step-3:- find the file having ".key" as it extension=> long press onit untill some options appear
   step-4:- click on "rename file"
   step-5:- save it as itsname.key.old
   step-6:- click on "reboot system"

JAILBREAKING:- (rooting of an appple phone)
==============
need:- for forensics:- to extract more and more data.
how-to:-
(a)Tethered - This method requires you to connect your iPhone to your computer and use an external application to jailbreak it. Once you restart your iPhone, the jailbreak is undone, 
(b)Semi-tethered - This method doesn't require you to connect your iPhone to a computer in order to jailbreak it, however the jailbreak is still undone every time you reboot your device
(c)Untethered - This method doesn't necessarily require a computer to perform a jailbreak on your device, and also modifies the iOS on a deeper level which means that no matter how many times you reboot your device, it stays jailbroken until you manually "unjailbreak" it.
=> apps to jailbreak an apple device:- Pangu or Cydia Impactor
     (https://downloadcydia.org/cydia-impactor/)

now, using the software:-
=> connecting phone:-
how to connect it:- (also above i have already shown how to connect phones)

then, we come to export menu
types of export:-
(a)specific selection:- usefull in law enforcement. it collects data b/w specified dates.
