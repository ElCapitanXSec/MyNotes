Methodology:
===========

port importance/significance:(higher -> more important)
	web port(http/https/)
	SMB
	FTP
	LDAP
	
Other ports necessary for recon:
	DNS
	SSL_cert(HTTPS)

combination of ports:
	dns + kerberos + ldap => it CONFIRMS Windows AD DomainController
	dns + http => 1st pentest dns(zone transfer) to get domain names
Windows AD:
	SMB => there are always some ANONMYOUS shares open
ldap:
	1. it indicates AD
	2. juicy data enumeration
smb share:
	1.some juicy file available
	2.shell upload if RW available
	3.samba exploit (eternal blue)

in case we have ADMIN_USER creds, but no ssh/webport/winrm and we have smb
	psexec
	smbexec
	wmiexec
