VEIL:
====
	Parts:
		Evasion => AV Evasion
		Ordance => Shellcode Generation
	Evasion:
		it has a lot of .py payloads for powershell/python/ruby/go/perl
		Naming of Payloads:
			payload_language/shell_type/payload_obfuscation
			shell_type:
				Meterpreter
				Shellcode Inject:
					They are designed to load shellcode into memory and execute it. These payloads give you the ability to write your own custom shellcode and run it. You can use these payloads to automatically create a user account on the system, spawn calc.exe, or anything you want via the shellcode you write or use.
					We can generate the shellcode via msfvenom or Ordance
		which language payload to chose?
			Lower-Level Language => the better AV evasion
				C>Golang
			Higher-Level Language:
				Ruby/Python/Powershell/Perl
		Chose the payload
		choose LHOST/LPORT
		it will create 3 files:
			payload.exe => executable payload
			payload.rc => metasploit file
			payload.c => source code
	Ordance:
		Used to generate shellcode for shellcode_inject payloads
