Corporate Pentest:
=================
http://www.pentest-standard.org
Steps:(10)
	Intelligence Gathering
	Initial Foothold
	Local/Network Enumeration
	Local Privilege Escalation
	Persistence
	Lateral Movement
	Domain Privilege Escalation
	Dumping Hashes
	Data Identification/Exfilteration
	Reporting
Flow:
	Initial Foothold can be gained via Social Engineering
	After Initial Foothold => Acquire a Privileged Account
	After a Privileged Account => Maintain Persistence for that account
	After Persistence => Privesc to SYSTEM Account
	After SYSTEM Account => Acquire a Domain-Privileged Account
	After acquiring differnt Domain Accounts => Acquire Domain-Admin (DA)
	After acquiring DA => Go to DC, DUMP Domain HASHES (ntds.dit)
	After having all HASHES  => attack PII (Personally Identified Information)
	Make a detailed Report
Reporting:
	It doesnt matter whether you've popped 3 or 300 boxes, if you dont tell the customer exactly what you did or if you dont help the customer understand the mitigations to resolve the issue
	Tips:
		Dont submit Nexpose/Nessuse report
			Have your own Template
			Validate your findings
		Rating your vulnerabilities
			Make a Matrix to Rate vulnerabilities
			Include refernces from NIST/DISA/CVSS/Personal Experience
		Theortical vs Real Findings:
			Theortical Findings => which have no actual exploit
				Give them low rating
		Solutions are just as important as findings
